## Technical Challenge Part 2 - Practical Applications
# Exploratory Analysis

The Customer Service team at Profeco (Mexican Consumer Protection Agency) wants to analyze the monitored products in Mexico. The IT team downloaded the database into an Google Drive on a CSV file of about 20GB; you can find the big file at: [Google Drive File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1crFR4yrS_6DV3_Fh-HrhANJg1-qlyE-O/view?usp=sharing)

Your task as a Data Engineer is processing the data and creating an exploratory analysis with Python Pandas without using pure Python functions. As an aid to help you start, a small sample of data from the file can be found at: [https://github.com/wizelineacademy/data-engineering-bootcamp/blob/main/data/sample.csv](https://github.com/wizelineacademy/data-engineering-bootcamp/blob/main/data/sample.csv)

#### **Respond to the following questions:**

1. How many commercial chains are monitored, and therefore, included in this database?
2. What are the top 10 monitored products by State?
3. Which is the commercial chain with the highest number of monitored products?
4. Use the data to find an interesting fact.
5. What are the lessons learned from this exercise?
6. Can you identify other ways to approach this problem? Explain.

### Deliverables

* Google Form with your forked GitHub repository URL containing your code.
* Python Code (Plain Script or Jupyter Notebook) on GitHub.
* Create a report that includes the responses to the questions, the lessons learned, and any additional comments. In this report, you can include diagrams and images that support your solution.
